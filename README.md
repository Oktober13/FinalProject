# The Dueling Association
Get your wands ready.

## What is this?
In this project, we created a Harry Potter dueling game. When a player waves a wand in a certain pattern, they cast a spell and inflict damage upon Voldemort. In the meantime, Voldemort inflicts a randomly generated amount of damage upon the player.
